# \#!nit


## Code with us.

Init was an idea born of the necessity for change, a change that would take you
from the drawing board of the classroom to pragmatic code. We built Init to
instil a culture of collaborative hacking and to forge a platform for
collective growth. Init is our love for code, pursued to share our love for
code. Init is our revolution to the everyday monotony of college. Init is our
contribution to growing a community we owe much to.

Init is our movement. Be a part of our movement.

For the :heart: of Open Source,\
The Init Crew

## Scripts

### JavaScript

**The chocolate sauce on the vanilla web.**
Conceived in the early days of the Internet, JavaScript was designed to be easy
to grasp yet powerful enough to turn static HTML into dynamic web applications.
The advent of Node.js and its asynchronous runtime has given JavaScript a
foothold in server side scripting and desktop apps. Through this Script we sail
through the fundamentals and capabilities of JavaScript as a tool in your
workbench.

## The Origin Story

```
There once was a group so misfit.
They started a movement on git.
Gathered their wit, pushed a commit,
And built what they called #!nit.
```
