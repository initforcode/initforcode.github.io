# \#!nit


## Code with us.
We built \#!nit from an idea born of the necessity for change, a change that
takes you from the drawing board of the classroom to pragmatic code.\
We built \#!nit to instil a culture of hacking through collaboration and to forge a
platform for collective growth through guidance.\
We built \#!nit to start a movement that reassess your take on development
focused on this change.\
We built \#!nit from our love for code.\
Share our movement. Code with us. :heart:

## Scripts

### JavaScript
#### The chocolate sauce on the vanilla web.

Conceived in the early days of the Internet, JavaScript was designed to be easy
to grasp yet powerful enough to turn static HTML into dynamic web applications.
The advent of Node.js and its asynchronous runtime has given JavaScript a
foothold in server side scripting and desktop apps. Through this Script we sail
through the fundamentals and capabilities of JavaScript as a tool in your
workbench.

## The Origin Story

```
There once was a group so misfit.
They started a movement on git.
Gathered their wit, pushed a commit,
And built what they called #!nit.
```
