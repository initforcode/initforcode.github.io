# \#!nit


## Code with us.

Init was an idea born of the necessity for change, a change that would take you from the drawing board of the classroom to pragmatic code. We built Init to instill a culture of collaborative hacking and to forge a platform for collective growth. Init is our love for code, pursued to share our love for code. Init is our revolution to the everyday monotony of college. Init is our
contribution to growing a community we owe much to.

Init is our movement. Be a part of our movement.

## ASD Sessions
In order to broaden our reach to you, we intend to conduct the ASD classes, henceforth called *insert expansion here* to talk about the approach and resources required to enter the world of Computer Science. An application oriented series of talks, we intend to touch upon various aspects of programming in terms of our experiences and expertise as well as aspects of practical need, such as placements, competitive coding, project management, etc.


## Scripts
Scripts have been designed to focus on core programming skills to give you a boost into development. Each session will walk your across the basics of a programming language or framework and gear you with enough intel to guide your progress through the murky waters of the Internet.

### JavaScript

**The Chocolate Sauce on the Vanilla Web.**\
Conceived in the early days of the Internet, JavaScript was designed to be easy to grasp yet powerful enough to turn static HTML into dynamic web applications. The advent of Node.js and its asynchronous runtime has given JavaScript a foothold in server side scripting and desktop apps. Through this Script we sail through the fundamentals and capabilities of JavaScript as a tool in your workbench.

## The Origin Story

```
There once was a group so misfit.
They started a movement on git.
Gathered their wit, pushed a commit,
And built what they called #!nit.
```
